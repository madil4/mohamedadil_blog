We as humans make mistakes; the life around us is so complex including our inside emotions. It is fine to do them but what is not, is these two things. First, sometimes, when we do something we don't think about what we did, so, we continue making mistakes without even realize (the worst case). The second wrong thing to do is, If we realize that there is something went wrong with our behavior, which is sometimes very difficult (blaming ourselves), we tend to not do something about it because of our ego.

The bottom line, reflect on your behavior, be neutral about whom to blame, if you are the one to blame, fix it, a little 'sorry' can be enough.
