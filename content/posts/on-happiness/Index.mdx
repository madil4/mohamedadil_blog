I don't know what happened in my life between the age of 22 and 27. I was pursuing materialistic goals and forgot about these three things that I believe bring more satisfaction in life.

Finding your thing; the thing that you do regularly and feel fulfilled by doing it. Like mastering playing the float, being a remarkable politician, or a talented dancer.

Enjoying the little things, like an insightful movie, a tasty food, feeding your plant, a concert of your favorite artist, or simply looking at the full moon for a while (little things!).

Lastly and most importantly, relationships. The ones who brought you to this life love to hear your voice. Embrace a pleasant evening with your guys where you share your embarrassing stories. There must be a saul out there with whom you share your secrets boundlessly, find it.
