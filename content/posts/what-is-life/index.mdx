Life for some is about:

- I obey God and seek his mercy.
- I find myself when she touches me or he holds me.
- I live my life to the fullest, life is short.
- I work hard; my career fuels my house and soul.
- I drink to forget why am I here. 
- I want to be the best of me: be healthy, pretty, and funny.
- I want you to look at me, I do exist.
- I want that degree, job, or house. That's it.
- I want to express myself and belong.
- I'm bored, entertain me.
- I just need to survive.
- Hey! I'm here for you, let me help.

Which one/s you can relate to?
