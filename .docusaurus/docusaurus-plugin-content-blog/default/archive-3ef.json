We will explore this concept briefly using examples from physics then we will see what we can learn from it. \n\nIf you want to study motions, study how the positions change with time (here I said \"change\" put some emphasis on that). Sound is the movement of particles traveling with time. So, the music we enjoy is some sort of change. Anything moving generates light, so the light we see is a result of moving particles, again, the mysterious change. Lastly, If we talked about heat, a hot object means its particles move at a higher speed compared to a colder one. So, it is all about movement and change.\n\nBy observing this surprising but obvious concept of change, we can be reminded to always change and seek improvements, otherwise, lights will appear dark, music will sound quiet, and relationships will feel cold. If we don't change, we are simply dead."

I talked about it in a previous post [How I run my life like a business\n](https://mohamedadil.com/how-I-run-my-life-like-a-business)\n- **Google Photos**: photos are great memories saver, I do take photos a lot, of almost everything that excites me and store them in the cloud to reflect on them later on.\n- **Instagram**: the stories feature is a big player in this regard, it not only allows you to take snippets of your life and share them but it will store them for you forever, so you can see how silly you were in your 60s.\n- **Diary**: I do journal a lot, especially when I'm feeling down, I only read them at the end of each year to reflect on them, you will understand yourself more when you write to yourself.\n- **Google Calander**: all events are stored on my calendar, so it's a good way to remember what happened that year.\n- **Bucket-list**: if you have a bucket-list, check out what you have done and look forward to the remaining boxes.\n\nI truly believe memories are the thing that will stick with you till the end, keep making good ones and store them, your brain is not good at this."

It will let us think that we should be perfect at what we do otherwise we have to quit. Also, It let us feel that we don't deserve the situation or the job that we have because we fuck up sometimes. It lets us feel like we are impostors.\n\nOne great example that illustrates its normal to be imperfect is when my favorite artist Adele forgot the words of a song while singing in a concert. She got terrified and nervous but she didn't freeze, she just started over and continued (watch her https://youtu.be/os5z7XZPXys?t=1m25s). That song was on the best-selling album of all time. It is fine to forget the words, she simply reminds us we are just human."

It goes beyond that, It will help us learn fast. Let me explain; The way our mind works is by forming patterns due to repetitions like memorizing a song or a language, these thinking patterns stick, and changing them becomes hard sometimes. Why children pick up faster then adults? they didn't develop these patterns yet so they are more open to new ideas.\n\nBeing open-minded is not hard, give any thought a chance, let it affects you, then decide if it for you or not."

No wonder why parents put their lives at the edge to see their children flourish. Also, no wonder why couples sacrifice for each other in the name of love. It just hurts them when they see their lovers hurt and this is what I think is the optimal connection."

      "content": "There are a lot of things and habits that I wanted to do but struggled to find the time or keep myself motivated, like going to the gym or finishing a book. Recently, I developed a trick that worked for me and might work for you.\n\nThe essence behind the trick is simple, challenge yourself by doing the habit you want in an intensive way (daily) but in a short time (two weeks). For example, my first challenge was \"14 days without internet\" which was an eye-opener. I wrote about it here https://mohamedadil.com/the-nasty-drug. \n\nThe reason behind the high intensity and the short duration is to trick my mind that I'm capable of doing it daily so after the challenge ends, it will be easier to do it at a relaxed pace. Also, it will fit easily in my routine because I will be kinda used to it.\n\nAnother important thing, while experiencing this new habit, your body or mood will react accordingly. Track these changes by writing a summary each day. For example, when I started to track my progress of working out daily for 14 days, I noticed that my mood was at its best after the workout, my sleeping got better, my body couldn't run for long distances nor do more than 10 pushups at the beginning. I could literally see how my body is strengthening with time and that was a huge boost of motivation."

I'm not against it but using it to pass time and to escape other important things in life is just like taking a dose of cocaine, which serves the same purpose.\n\nI learned from this experience that addiction is not related to the misuse of drugs but something more fundamental. It is linked to your basic needs both physical and mental (like the need for belonging). If they are not satisfied, your body gives you a sign (a pain, like in depression). Instead of numbing that pain through drugs or any sort of escaping addiction, identify what the need is, and work on it, maybe a kind listening friend is all you need."

Here are a few ideas that I borrow from the business world to pursue my life goals.\n\n##### Vision & Goals\nAs any company has a vision a oneself should have too. For me, it is oriented around career, relationships, and myself. These are my long-term goals. \n![vision](./goals.png)\n\n##### Money & Time\nThe short-term goals are inspired by the long-term ones and I set them at the beginning of each year with their budget and time as shown. If I don't do that they will be just something to dream about.\n![money-time](./planner.png)\n\n##### Productivity\nDefining a budget and time is not enough. They should be further divided into small achieveable tasks.\n![Productivity](./tasks.png)\n\n##### Error-log\nI’ve realized how fruitful the error log is in making a healthy company. So I have a sheet where I log my mistakes and achievements. This gives me a sense of the time I’m spending.\n![Error-log](./log-sheet.png)\n\n##### Marketing\nA personal blog is a great tool to market yourself. It gives you the window to express your interests and showcase your projects. My email me@mohamedadil.com always refer to this blog (marketing at no cost 😉)\n\nAt last, you don't have to make money to be a successful entrepreneur."

Frederik, the speaker presents the answer in a simple elegant way. What causes the discomfort either has to do with you or with them. I will explain with a story.\n\nOnce upon a time, I had a crush on a girl who we usually play volleyball with. One day, I collected my courage and decided to have a chat with her to know her more beyond our small talks. What happens is she ignored my questions and disappeared. I felt a pain in my chest and asked myself: should I take it personally?\n\nAt first, I thought it was about me, I know that I'm not as good with girls as I'm with computers 😅 so I thought this is what caused that pain. Frederik recommends in this case to give yourself empathy and speak up your need.\n\nThen, I thought again, maybe it is not about me, maybe she is going through a tough time, so I asked her if everything is alright? she opened up and started to tell me about how life is hitting hard on her.\n\nIt might be about you and your insecurities, or it might be about them and their needs. In both cases, life is too short to keep up with your ego, let it go."

The thesis has paved the way for my upcoming new project, which is a plugin for Grasshopper that features Static/Explicit/Implicit simulations with robust non-linear capabilities.\n\nI would like to thank my supervisor, Akke Suiker for his generous support and all the people who help me throughout the journey.\n\n![Graduation-Mohamed-Adil](./graduation-mohamed-adil.jpg)"
