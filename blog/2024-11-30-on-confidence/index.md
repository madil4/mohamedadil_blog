Confidence is a bit of a vague word that we often use, but what does it actually mean? It is not a personality trait written in your genes; it is a skill that you can learn, and it requires practice just like any other skill. But what should you practice and gain experience in?

I would say life experience. The world is big—why live in a small bubble? Why stay in the same daily job for years? Why not challenge your comfort zone and try something new? Why not read about philosophy and understand how people think? The list goes on.

While going through different life experiences is valuable, that alone is not enough to develop the skill of self-confidence. You also need to be “resilient.” By resilient, I mean “sharp!” Haha, kidding. What I mean is that if you’re hit by harsh rejection, it shouldn’t bring you down or discourage you from trying again. Accept it as part of life—just as you give rejection, you should be able to receive it. Ultimately, when you’re confident, more doors will open for you, because you’re knocking on them, not waiting for someone else to open them for you.
