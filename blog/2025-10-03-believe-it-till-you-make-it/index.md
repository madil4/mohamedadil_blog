We all face challenges in life, and the way to tackle them isn’t always clear. Is it motivation? Determination? Or just luck? For example, how do we achieve that ideal body shape, build a successful company, or find the right partner or job?

If your goal is realistic and achievable, like losing weight or landing a job, it often comes down to believing in the process and staying determined. You have to push through self-doubt, laziness, and embarrassment.

But if your goal is highly uncertain, like building an innovative business, the mindset is different. You still need to believe in the process, but you also need flexibility to accept failure, adapt, and steer the wheel with every lesson learned. In this case, being overly resilient in just one direction might actually hold you back.

What I’m really saying is: there’s no universal recipe for overcoming challenges. But one thing is essential, self-belief. Even if it’s temporary, believe it till you make it.
