I always have this dilemma when I’m not sure about something, shall I stand for my opinion or try to not form an opinion at all? For example, why Barcelona football team lost their match? Why did the housing market go up? why did she get mad of me?

Not forming an opinion reflects a weak personality plus it's boring, however, forming a strong opinion on something that you’re not sure about shows how stupid you are! 

In my opinion, if the situation is not serious, form an opinion, Barcelona lost because they lost Messi, who cares! but if it is a serious situation, ask the opinion of someone who knows better than you, if you can’t, then make one and stick to it until you know better.
