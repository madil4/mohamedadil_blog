After 9 months of hard work, I have defended my graduation thesis obtaining an MSc in Structural Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology.

In my thesis, “Numerical methods in the analysis of geometrically non-linear structures” I have studied and compared different nonlinear approaches for solving geometrically nonlinear problems. The thesis has paved the way for my upcoming new project, which is a plugin for Grasshopper that features Static/Explicit/Implicit simulations with robust non-linear capabilities.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Akke Suiker for his generous support and all the people who help me throughout the journey.
