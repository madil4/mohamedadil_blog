Why do we find it exciting when something is different or new? Why do we thrive on exploring the unknown and unraveling mysteries? Is our brain programmed to develop new patterns and continuously evolve? Is what we feel as 'excitement' a result of our brain's reward system responding to these improvements? Is it all about facing challenges rather than reaching the goal?

If that is the case, should we find more happiness in identifying problems rather than in finding solutions? Because once a problem is solved, then what?

This might sound a bit pessimistic when defining fun and excitement, but it's merely an observation of reality. Knowing this, it should be good news, as finding problems tends to be easier than solving them. Challenges provide us with direction and keep us motivated unless they become exceptionally difficult to tackle. Challenges should serve as our fuel for enjoyment rather than sources of suffering.
