I don’t know if you have noticed this, but if we generally think too much we get overwhelmed and stressed. On the other hand, if we have nothing to think about we become bored and stressed. What a weird brain we have!

To live happily in this life we have to limit stress, and sometimes thinking can be stressful. One solution to this dilemma is to simplify our life so we don’t have to think too much about keeping the thing we have or acquiring the thing we don’t. Choosing what is important is a whole topic on its all that I have touched on it in a previous post [On Happiness](https://mohamedadil.com/on-happiness).

For example, if your room contains only the essentials you don’t have to worry about maintaining or cleaning a lot of stuff. Similarly, if you have fewer friends you will not be obliged to attend many birthday parties that you don’t feel like going to.

At last, if we keep our life minimal suddenly we start valuing the thing we own since they became scarce just as gold.
